Hello there!
This virtual Rubik's Cube supports the following:
1: Scrambling:
   generate and print a random scramble of a specified length:
      make ARGS="random n", where n is the length of the desired scramble
   feed a scramble in cube notation from a text file (see scramble.txt for an example):
      make ARGS="read filename"
   feed the colors of each of the cube's stickers in a flat layout from a text file
   (see layout.txt for an example):
      make ARGS="see filename"
   After the scramble is processed, the resulting cube is printed in a flat layout

2: Interaction:
   start a terminal based interactive script:
      make ARGS=interact
