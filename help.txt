1: Scrambling:
   generate a random scramble. prints the resulting scramble as well:
      make ARGS="random n", where n is the length of the desired scramble
   feed a scramble in cube notation from a text file. prints the scramble as well:
      make ARGS="read filename"
   feed the colors of each of the cube's stickers in a flat layout from a text file:
      make ARGS="see filename"
   After the scramble is processed, the resulting cube is printed in a flat layout
